<p>Hi, I’m Akshat Saxena. I’m a passionate learner with a strong interest in data science, especially how it connects with domains like finance and technology. I enjoy exploring the power of Python, working with data, and creating meaningful insights through storytelling and visualization. Currently, I’m building my skills in areas like machine learning, CSS for web development, and 8085 microprocessor programming.
I’m naturally curious, and I love understanding how things work—whether it’s designing a portfolio website, analyzing mutual fund investments, or creating a movie recommendation system. In my free time, I like to dive into technical topics, explore online learning platforms, and challenge myself with new projects that blend creativity and logic.
I believe in continuous growth, and I’m working toward a future where I can apply data science to solve real-world problems—possibly in the finance sector or tech industry.<br>
